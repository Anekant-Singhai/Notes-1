> Github dorks:
    remember to search most efficiently here , these are the vaults of code that a company has , so look for material that can lead to :
        info disclosure
        bugs found in code
        critical section of code that wasn't to be revealed


        [#] start either the name of the firm itself , then go step by step adding the keywords as you like :
			"tesla.com" -> "tesla.com" <keywords>
			keywords like: password , passwd , key , api , login, ftp ,token , {ss is there in pictures (sublime)}
			developers tend to be adding the loose ends and we get the privelage to exploit them
			
		[#] <domain> filename:<filename> like dockercfg_auth (you need to know which files have the passwords ) , id_rsa (client side), id_dsa , aws_access_key_id, ssh_key, s3cfg , manifest.xml ,vim_Settings.xml,sftp-config.json, secrets.yml, .env file

		target the developers , they have the loose ends most of the time , they do all the back-end stuff
		
		[#] file extensions -> extension:<fileextension>
		 
		[#] check the linkedin for the employees and then find them on github , search their repos. Filter the result in the linkedin for devs and check their repos for leaked info , manually 
		 they may have the alias and thus check for their contribution for open source and can get thier alias
