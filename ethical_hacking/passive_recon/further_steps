> how to find the public ip:
			while getting hands-on the ip , always first see the service provider and check whether the isp is providing for that particular region or not
			
			resolve ip via dig <name> 
			the go to iptolocation.net and put the ip
				it can be self hosted or some other region is shown
				when we can't get the public ip , we try to give him our server's link and our server will have the log and it's public ip: grabify.link	, use this to create a link and paste the real url that you wanna make the guy visit , this way we get the public ip , we not trying to phish 
				
				if you are a linux user give the command: "curl ifconfig.me" for getting public ip
				
			or if you have the server and you want to store the ip seperately you can there's php script that we can give to index.html , converting it to index.php
