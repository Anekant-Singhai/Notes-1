> Shodan
these are all dork examples: change as you need:
		[#]net:192.31.242.0/24 - gives the devices available in network
		[#]net:192.31.242.0/24 port:80 
		[#]net:192.31.242.0/24 port:80 product:"Microsoft httpd service"
		[#]net:192.31.242.0/24 port:80 os:"windows xp"
		
		[#]org:"organization name"
		[#]country:"US"
		[#]geo:"<lat> <long>"	
		[#]title:"intitle like google"
		
		shodan also has the power to access the ssl certs: just take the official name of cert from the site 
		info and then give the dork-> ssl:"<cert>" and then we get the cert info as well as the ip's it runs
		ssl.cert.subject.cn:"<common cert name>"
		
		check the favicons also sometimes they alter everything and favicons remain same so this reveals something too
		
		we can also use the api that is the fast solution but restricts the search to limited 
		[tool] shodan api tools, shodan terminal:
			apt install python3-shodan, then we'ed have to configure it wrt to api
			
				[#]shodan init <apikey>
				[#] shodan search
					while searching there is no colon applied in the terminal , whereas give the spave instead of it
					-h for help
					
					also google: how to download data with shodan if any error persists
				[#] shodan download <query> -> download the query results
