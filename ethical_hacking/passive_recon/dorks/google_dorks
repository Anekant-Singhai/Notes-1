how do search engines work?
    the basic idea of searching any webpage is applied to the google also 
    we can have a better manipulation on the google searches if we target some specific keywords that the google seaches in the webpage and gives us the more relevant , precise and concise result.
    google "spiders" the web pages with the help of the tool called spider that google built for seaching

    So manipulation  of search results with the help of keywords is called Dorking
    Dorking applies anywhere , where the search is involved 

    so if you want to know how this spider worked in earlier times there's a tool that mimics it called "SEO-Spider" ...go tinker

    to install it refer this website :

> Google dorks:

    starting with the keywords that can help us in google searching:

        -> when you want range: give the dots between the values
		 	like you want price range
		 	$1000...$2000 <keyword>
		 	 
		-> wildcard "*"  , when we want the all records related to the specific query like: how to make * with tomatoes
		-> focus on specific keyword : use single or double quotations
		
		-> OR keyword
		-> + operator for keywords 
		
		
	advanced operators:
	rules:	
		no space btw the operator and search term
	
	operators:
		intitle:
		allintitle:
